#ME382PentRob
It is very important that anyone that reads this and looks at my code understand that I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I'M DOING HERE. I've never programmed for this type of thing before, and this is my attempt at learning. If you know about Arduino programming and want to tell me how wrong I am about any of this stuff, please do not hesitate to do so.

* I'm using a function called DCmotor to take all the controller inputs, turn them into values the driver can use, and then make the motors do their thing. This seems to me like it will improve the overall tidiness of the code and make it easier to write.
* I'm going to make a function that easily stops a pair of motors, probably once construction of the robot commences.
* I'm trying my hand at making a library to do what these functions I'm writing do. It's not quite there yet, but it's close.
* I still do not know how to use git. I'm working on this.
