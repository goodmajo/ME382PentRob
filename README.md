It is very important that anyone that reads this and looks at my code understand that I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I'M DOING HERE. I've never programmed for this type of thing before, and this is my attempt at learning. If you know about Arduino programming and want to tell me how wrong I am about any of this stuff, please do not hesitate to do so.
